# gilbert-frontmatter-markdown

The default markdown loader in Gilbert will not process the frontmatter in your documents.
This is a deliberate decision (and is not a bug) since Gilbert is a general purpose static site generation framework and therefore cannot make sweeping assumptions about markdown document contents. 

If however you are using frontmatter in your markdown documents you may wish to use this loader.
